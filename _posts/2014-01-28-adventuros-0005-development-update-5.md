title: "AdventurOS 0.0.05: Development Update #5"
---

<p>Hello everyone! </p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/dXjykBO.gif" style="float:right;" alt="">
<p>We are working hard on the awesome AdventurOS, which keeps progressively evolving and getting closer and closer to its Beta stage. </p>

<p>(If you are part of the alpha team get your new version here: <a href="/alpha" target="_blank">http://adventuros.evelend.com/alpha/</a> ) </p>

<p>The alpha access is a reward for all those who have believed in our project since the very beginning and supported us with significant contributions. However, we have got such a big wave of newcomers offering their collaboration that we are considering a contest where some more alpha accesses can be obtained. Stay tuned! </p>

<p>From now on and until the auto-updater is ready, we will release updates every other week, so there is more content in each of them. </p>

<p>This update includes a brand new concept regarding monsters, being their size based on the length of the file name and their color based on the first character of it. </p>

<p>There is much more content that you can check at the changelog. </p>
<p>We are especially happy to be finally presenting you the first version that works for Linux, after struggling to get through numerous compatibility issues. </p>
