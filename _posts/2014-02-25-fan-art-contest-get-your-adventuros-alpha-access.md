<p>To all Gnududes of the real:</p>

<p>A big chance is knocking at your door!

<p>We have recently got big amounts of messages requesting a chance to make a donation in exchange for the alpha access purchased by our Indiegogo backers.
Please, understand that with their contribution they did not only buy an access, but vouched for us while still at an early stage, so their rewards for their trust and belief must be kept exclusive.</p>

<p>However, the team faces a low demographic rate of Gnududes (Linux users, that is), and all kind members of the AdventurOS family are up to making room for some of you guys!</p>

<p>If you want to be one of our Linux testers, submit your Fan Art piece to Twitter with the hashtag #adventurosfanart before March 10th.</p>
<p>On March 10th two winners will get the Alpha access right away.</p>
