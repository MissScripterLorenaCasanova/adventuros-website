<p>Hello Adventurers!</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights of the last development weeks: </p>

<p>We are introducing an easy to use menu that will contain all the information you need to keep track of your location, inventory, stats and skills. </p>
<p>The castle’s map is being developed and will be displayed on a unique way so you can know where you are and where you have already been. You will be able to set a waypoint to a folder you already visited so you can travel without checking on the map. </p>
<p>The inventory is divided in different subsections so it’s always organized and tidy. Items can be acquired by killing monsters and/or found inside chests. </p>

<p>A new level generator is on its way to arrive to AdventurOS alpha. Rooms will be generated differently and there will be 3 main layouts: big rooms, corridors and towers. Mixing these 3 different kinds of level generators, the game will give a similar experience to a Castlevania map.</p>
<p>After finishing the level generator and the menu we will be working on adding items, monsters, and environments to the game.</p>
<p>On the next Alpha build you will be able to experience the full power of the AdventurOS inventory.</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback and bug reports! We are getting very close to the point where Alpha becomes Beta!</p>
