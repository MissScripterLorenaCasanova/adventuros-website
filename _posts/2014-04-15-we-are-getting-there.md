<p>Hello Adventurers,</p>
<p>We have exciting news! </p>
<p>We are working really hard to include all the basic features we can into the next Alpha version of the promising AdventurOS.</p>
<p>And it looks like this will be the last Alpha release, smoothing the way for quality Beta times. On time!</p>
<p>It is wonderful to watch all of AdventurOS pieces starting to fit together, we are really looking forward to the testing and feedback from the Steam community, so the spring release we promised is very, very likely to be fulfilled in no time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please feel free to get in touch with your impressions, questions or suggestions, and remember it was you guys who made this possible and we could not be more grateful for this opportunity.</p>
<p>Thanks and keep enjoying, we love you all!</p>
