<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>In Evelend we continue working hard in order to get all the basic features ready for the next release, and then we will be almost set to launch the early access version of AdventurOS, specially focusing on a mod-friendly environment.</p>

<p>We have a some new tools which will make easier the development and mod creation. For instance, a fully functional level editor will be available giving the user a good way to create cohesive and fun to play levels for the directory interpreter.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve redesigned the main menu, the intro and we have gone deeper into the main quest of the adventure mode.</p>

<p>We'll be satisfied only when we feel that what we have in our hands  is a functional and interesting first product before releasing the early-access, containing a logical amount of playability and testing for the betterment of next releases, and of course including all the modding tools we are developing so far and a user friendly guide on the matter.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience!
<br>We love you all.</p>
