<p>We proudly introduce you to some of the characters that will make your journey easier in exchange for your fight against the curse.
The rooms in your castle are infected and must be cleaned.
Killing every monster in the area will make it clean.</p>

<p>This will not modify your files! Villagers and NPCs will spawn there, replacing the defeated monsters, as long as the file exists..</p>

<h3>Meet the Stylist</h3>

<p>To encounter a stylist you first have to clean a room with vector graphics. The quantity of files determines the quantity of the hairstyles and other customization options that are available. (Only 1 vector graphic will transform, the rest will spawn as regular villagers).</p>

<h3>Meet the Blacksmith</h3>

<p>(File type is yet to be decided) Just like with the stylist, the quantity of files will determine the content the blacksmith has for you to trade.
He has two different shapes, and it will grow bigger if there are more files of its kind.
He can craft all kinds of weapons and armor, and will be able to upgrade your current gear at a reasonable price!</p>

<p>Next week we will introduce new characters and there will be more news about development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we announced that the first public version of the game would be available in spring but it will have to wait to see the light until summer.</p>
