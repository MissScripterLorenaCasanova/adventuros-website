<p>Hello once again for some refreshing news on AdventurOS development.</p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1gaYxXw.gif" alt="">
<p>Many people have asked us about the file extensions that might not be recognized by default in AdventurOS. </p>
<p>If the game encounters an extension that was not contemplated on our design, a random monster will spawn taking that extension's role.</p>
<p>BUT, what if we do not want a random monster in one of our custom extensions? We have a way cooler option for you guys!</p>
<p>Allow us to introduce you to the Monster Creator!</p>

<p>With this simple program you will be able to create and edit monsters so they can be bound with any file extension you want.</p>
<p>For instance, letâ€™s say we have a saved file called "my_game.sav" and we want AdventurOS to generate a fire monkey whenever we find any .sav file.</p>

<p>After creating this monster you will find it in game whenever you come across files with your chosen extension for that monster to appear.</p>

<p>An awesome feature of the Monster Creator is the possibility to share your monsters with other Adventurers if you wish to.</p>
<p>You will also be able to download and use other people's creations with a simple url pasting.</p>

<p>We have some other teasers to give you today:</p>

<h3>Meet the Mechanic</h3>

<p><b>Mechanics</b> (Created from shortcuts) Their mission will be protecting the links between rooms and managing all the portal system of the castle.<br>
They will be the ones with tools such as locked doors or hyperlinks. </p>

<h3>Meet the Monk</h3>

<p><b>Monks</b> (Created out of all kinds of audio files) Each audio file generates a monk plus a CD item.<br>
When the item is given to a monk, it stays attached to the monk as the piece they will later interpret by turns, because, you know, that will be their thing.<br>
We expect the monks to reproduce your audio files, but we cannot promise the will not include funny distortions too!<br>
While the monks sing, you can receive useful temporary buffs such as increased experience.</p>

<p>We will hopefully be sharing AdventurOS fun very soon. Meantime, we want to thank you all for all the great support we are receiving!<br><br>

Cheers!<br>
The team.</p>
