<p>Hello our dear Adventurers! We have a very good surprise for you!</p>

<p>We have worked a lot to get where AdventurOS is today, and by now you already know how much we are struggling to finally put the result out there. For those who need to refresh it here is Lorena&#39;s <a href="http://lorena.evelend.com/indie-heaven-and-hell/">illustrative article.</a></p>

<p>We have contacted each and every one of you privately, but we would also like to publicly thank you for all the great feedback we got after sharing our experience, for the support letters and messages, for your tweets and retweets, for spreading the AdventurOS word and for all the different ways in which you have showed us your love. You are an amazing source of indie gaming awesomeness. Really.</p>

<p>Among all messages and within the whole development period we have got flooded with requests for us to accept donations and pre-purchases.</p>

<p>Besides the<a href="https://sellfy.com/p/vL28/"> wallpapers pack</a>, there has been no chance to purchase anything after AdventurOS Indiegogo campaign finished.</p>

<p>UNTIL NOW!</p>

<p>If you are reading this, then the AdventurOS <a href="http://adventuros.evelend.com/store/">pre-purchase option</a> is already up and running.</p>

<p>Our delay, forced by our unexpected bureaucratic problems, motivated us to keep improving what was supposed to be the first Beta version, by adding more content. And more. And more! We are also polishing the existing features. And polishing... and polishing.</p>

<p>This train moves forward at full speed and the whole thing looks damn good!</p>

<p>Once the first Early Access version is out, you will receive that one plus all further builds.</p>

<p>Only the few brave people who trusted us with contributions for the right perks on Indiegogo from the very beginning can enjoy the privilege of playing the latest alpha builds of the game before the early-access release.</p>

<p>But it won&#39;t be long before all of you get the great looking AdventurOS Early Access that will soon see the light on Steam!</p>

<p>We hope we are properly reaching everyone and listening to all requests.</p>

<p>Besides everything explained above, and after many messages requesting the same, we have finally created a <a href="http://adventuros.evelend.com/blog/feed/">RSS feed</a> for everyone to stay updated from now on through any chosen reader.</p>

<p>We feel utterly happy to see how AdventurOS concept, which we once wanted to bring to life out of pure creativity and passion, quickly becomes contagiously wished and supported by so many people.</p>

<p>And we are making it happen!</p>

<p>Thanks again for everything and let there be games!</p>

<p>Love,<br />
Evelend Team</p>
