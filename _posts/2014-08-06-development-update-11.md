<p>With the item creator, you can create (no shit Sherlock) any item for the game and share it with your friends as well.<br />
The price and drop rate of your item will be automatically generated based on its stats. By doing this we avoid disproportionate items on the game, so whatever you create will stay balanced with the rest.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for all the <a href="http://adventuros.evelend.com/store/">pre-purchases</a>!<br />
Oh! And&hellip; on that note&hellip; we have another surprise for you!<br />
If you are one of the pre-purchasers, you have automatically entered a raffle.<br />
The winner will be able to take part of the alpha testing too!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>

<p>Hugs from the AdventurOS team!<br>
