<p>Greetings, dear AdventurOS family!<br />
<img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1409778487.png" /><br />
We remain in that point where the job is done but the bureaucracy to release it is not yet sorted out.<br />
The struggle is so big right now that all of us three have even moved in order to survive this delay.<br />
<br />
However, not everything is a struggle. AdventurOS still has most part of our energy and attention. This is good for us, as this is an awesome process that we are proud to be part of, and it is also good for you, because the first releasable version keeps getting better and better, so once it is out, it will be a much better product than we thought it would be at its Early Access stage.<br />
The least we can do to make up for the delay is keeping up the constantly increasing game awesomeness.<br />
<br />
Today we will tease you a little bit more by introducing you to your main character and its possibilities.</p>

<p>The adventure will happen on your computer, but who is our protagonist?</p>

<p>The gameplay will follow the adventures of a simple file you will create.<br />
You will be able to customize that file in many ways.<br />
Gender, name, and hairstyle are attributes that other games already let you personalize when it comes to character customization, but what&#39;s unique about AdventurOS is that since our hero is a file, you get to choose its extension.<br />
What will that mean for your hero?<br />
Each extension will have different attributes, skills and items to begin with, and the player will adopt the color of that extension&rsquo;s family, having the other files with the same extension as allies.<br />

<p>The high perk contributors to our Indiegogo campaign should expect an upgrade and more news very soon.<br />

We would also like to thank you all for your support messages. We like to personally write back to everyone and we do our best to not to delay much in our replies.<br />
<br />
So, as always, thank you all so much! We love you!</p>
