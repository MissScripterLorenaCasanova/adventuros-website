<p>Hello dear Adventurers,<br />
<br />
You might be aware of the latest news regarding our bureaucratic struggle. In case you are not, you might be interested in checking out <a href="http://lorena.evelend.com/bureaucrazy/">Lorena&rsquo;s article</a> on the subject.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, development keeps moving forward. And we can&rsquo;t wait to the Early Access release!<br />
<br />
Today we will give you a glimpse of another small piece of AdventurOS: Lately we have focused on improving the skill menu, so here&rsquo;s a teaser:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1412291168.jpg" /></p>

<p>Every time you perform an adventure related action (Entering unopened rooms, completing a quest, defeating a boss) you will earn Adventure Points. With this special points you will be able to build your character skills the way you want them by selecting your chosen formula between magic upgrades, weapon skills or abilities.</p>

<p>When creating your character a few basic skills will be already active so you can start with a preset.</p>

<p>You can follow this process and more through our site. You can stay updated by the team on <a href="https://twitter.com/AdventurOSgame">Twitter </a>too.<br />
We also had the nice surprise of finding out a kind active member of Reddit had long ago created a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/adventuros/">subreddit about AdventurOS</a>, and he has gifted us the chance to participate and keep it up to date too. Check it out!<br />
<br />
We would like to thank you once more for your support. We are flooded with kind words and warm wishes and we are doing our best to reach everyone back as soon as possible. Once again, thank you so much. We love you all!</p>
