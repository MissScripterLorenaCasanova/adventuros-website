<p>Hello again, our dear Adventurers!<br />
<br />
Regardless of the bitter side of being indies and on our own, we are enjoying every second of development of the game, and you will very soon be playing it your way, at your very own realm.<br />
We are a team of three grinches, all equally overwhelmed and confused by Christmas time. However, we know for many it does bring reunions and well deserved free time. Maybe you are up to some AdventurOS music?<br />
<br />
It is just about time for contributors with Floppy-disc perk or higher to enjoy the volume I of the amazing AdventurOS OST.<br />
<p>
