<p>Happy new year,&nbsp;dear&nbsp;Adventurers!<br />
Last year was&nbsp;full of adventures of all kinds for Evelend&nbsp;team, and this one will be full of adventures for you!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We are very&nbsp;excited to see what lies&nbsp;ahead for all of us immediately after&nbsp;the last steps of our&nbsp;bureaucratic&nbsp;odyssey.<br />
We wish we could have given&nbsp;an earlier release, but the bright side is that AdventurOS becomes more and more&nbsp;awesome every day in the meantime.<br />
We want to&nbsp;thank you all for&nbsp;your messages and gestures of support and we are sure this will be worth all the efforts we put into it.<br />
<br />
Today we are unfolding&nbsp;AdventurOS development a&nbsp;bit more for you.<br />
<br />
Firstly, a&nbsp;big improvement is taking place right now.<br />
A second engine that will make mobs way more&nbsp;dynamic and fun to play is being&nbsp;implemented&nbsp;and will be merged with the current one.&nbsp;<br />
We are focused&nbsp;on providing&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;fights, a broader spectrum of&nbsp;skills&nbsp;and overall better&nbsp;flow at our castle&#39;s platforms,&nbsp;making the experience&nbsp;more&nbsp;interesting and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Secondly, we have also improved a few other things, getting as a result:<br />
<br />
- A higher number of ways to personalize your monsters through&nbsp;the&nbsp;mob customization system.<br />
- A more efficient&nbsp;light engine that allows a better performance<br />
- A&nbsp;room interpreter that will make our castle&nbsp;resemble our computer&#39;s&nbsp;visible folders and files&nbsp;even better.</p>

<p>Some&nbsp;upgrades wished by the team for&nbsp;AdventurOS&#39;&nbsp;first release&nbsp;are&nbsp;yet to be crafted, but we are positive&nbsp;the upcoming release will contain them all.<br />
<br />
All features in general&nbsp;continue&nbsp;according to plan&nbsp;and we have an early version of the game running for the&nbsp;contributors to our Indiegogo campaign with the highest perks.</p>

<p>Besides the administrative struggle for the sake of independence, we have also encountered a lot of technical challenges in the process of development,&nbsp;but we guess that is something to expect when you work&nbsp;on a product that is just unique.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We can&#39;t wait to put it out there!</p>

<p>We would like&nbsp;to remind&nbsp;everyone who has contributed to the Indiegogo campaign with the &ldquo;CD&rdquo; perk (and higher)&nbsp;that you should have received a link to the OST via&nbsp;e-mail.<br />
In case&nbsp;you did not receive&nbsp;the e-mail, please feel free to get in touch!<br />
