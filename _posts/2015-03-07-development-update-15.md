<p>Greetings Adventurers!<br />
<br />
First of all, thank you ever so much for your words and gestures of support.<br />
You will very soon be playing the super awesome AdventurOS.<br />
<br />
Today we are letting you look through a crack of our castle&#39;s wall.<br />
Here you have several gameplay gifs.<br />

<br />
Among other elements, we are working on the environment, the power-ups and the monsters, and the result is a much better flow when it comes to gameplay.<br />
Also, many spells have already been implemented, and they look and feel great!<br />
<br />

There will be 7 different kinds of spells and 6 elements. These combined make a total of 42 spells to discover and master!<br />

We are also proud to announce that once the game is out for sale, we will accept bitcoins, as so many of you wished and kindly requested.<br />
It will be available as an alternative to the conventional currencies or services.<br />
<br />
Thank you so very much for your patience. We promise it will all be worth it!<br />
<br />
We love you all!</p>
