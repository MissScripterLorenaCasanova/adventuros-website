<p>We know you have been wondering about the plot. Here's finally an article telling a bit about it.</p>

<p>The story begins with your recently installed convoy arriving into the castle.
This happens to take place in the middle of a crisis within its walls, which seem to have gone through some kind of curse.
The castle has turned very dangerous, full of creatures and traps, and there is no room for any newcomers.</p>

<p>Your group offers help “cleaning up” the castle in exchange for shelter.
The rules state that “Everyone and everything the Architect lets in, shall stay, unless the Architect, and no one else, decides otherwise” This is why these people eventually accept your help, but not without you having to struggle first with the long-established policies and protocols of the castle and some of the most powerful individuals in it, who seem to be rather eager to kick you out of there.</p>

<p>It will not be long until you end up in the epicentre of an internal dispute which threatens to make the whole place fall apart. It will be your mission to unravel the truth behind the conspiracy and to save the filers, (the citizens), from the cruel destiny awaiting in the deep dark corners of the castle, all under the watchful eye of the Architect. </p>

<p>What’s the nature of the curse? Who does the whole situation benefits and why? What's on stake? Are you ready? </p>
