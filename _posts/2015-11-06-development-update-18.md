<p>Good morning, afternoon and evening, fellow Adventurers!</p>

<p>We Evelend team are fully focused on work here in Tokyo. We are now reunited and able to share the same “office” and to finally work side by side after so much remote collaboration.</p>
<p>We are a having a very productive time here, but we have a limited number of months to spend together, so the goals are making the best out of it and pave the way for a smooth transition back to remote work when it’s time to part again. Sigh...</p>

<p>Most of our latest work has been focused on the replacement of all the code in Python by code in Go (golang), because of Python’s limitations when it comes to distributing executables.</p>
<p>This is especially an issue for Windows users, given that OSX and Linux have it pre-installed.</p>
<p>These Windudes messing with us again… but hey! a deal is a deal and this game is going to be available to all!</p>

<p>Those kind Indiegogo contributors who chose the highest perks should have received an email from us about displaying their info in AdventurOS credits, so if you are one of those contributors but you have not received the email, please get in touch with us!</p>

<p>And now a thank you note to all our supporters.Big and small. Pioneer and late additions. Thank you so much. This is all possible thanks to you.</p>

<p>We wish you a wonderful gaming time, see you soon for more updates about AdventurOS game! </p>
<br>
<p>Love you all!</p>
