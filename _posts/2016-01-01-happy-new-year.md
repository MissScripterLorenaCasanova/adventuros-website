<p>Hello everyone! Our months working together in Tokyo were wonderful development-wise, but now it's time to part and be back to remote collaboration.</p>

<p>We will miss each other very much.</p>


<p>Should our passport country (Spain) be in a different phase, I think we'd all give settling here a shot. However, this country is far from being a self-employed or freelance-friendly one, and it is especially unadvised if you work in the software industry.</p>


<p>There is a chance that the strongest emergent party could change that in the long run, but it does not seem to be going to happen in the near future. Now Spain doesn't even have a government to begin with!</p>


<p>Whatever happens, and wherever each of us chooses to spend 2016, we have just charged batteries together and are determined to take AdventurOS very far. We apologize again for the unrealistc deadline we once set, but it will all be worth it, for us and also for you guys.</p>

<p>We have so far walked a path of exploration and discovery of our own profession, of the industry and all other (rather stupid) rules that may (and will!) apply. </p>

<p>Thanks for walking along with us!</p>


<p>Now, if you are curious about what's lately on our desks, we can start by telling you how pleased we are to have replaced the Python indexer side with golang.</p>

<p>Also, the Story Mode took shape and we are loving it!</p>


<p>Development processes are usually surrounded by much secrecy, but this time we have cool footage to show you guys, and you can choose what to see next by leaving your suggestions in the comments below.</p>

<p>We love you all!</p>
