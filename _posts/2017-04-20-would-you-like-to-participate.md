<p> Hello dear Adventurers!</p>
<p>Evelend Team here, back to our usual, scattered around the globe, individual desks after another wonderful reunion in the insane city of Tokyo.</p>

<p>We are working really hard to make this year an amazing one for AdventurOS and for you Adventurers, who have walked alongside us during this long, painful gestation.</p>

<p>We are currently working on several fronts at the same time, but the story mode is our main focus at the moment.

If we were starting the project today, we would definitely NOT use GMS, which we chose in order to make the best out of the combination of a pro coder (Emilio) and a learning coder (Lorena) in what we though was a brief, low footprint project (ha!).</p>
<p>We have tried GMS2 which sucks even more, and we all think that Godot is what we would choose if the project was to be started in the present.

Even though we don't love the engine, we are starting to be happy with what we see.</p>

<p>It's been an exciting and productive time in Tokyo for us three during our amazing reunion, and now we need you to join the team too! Would you like to participate?

For better room generation results, we are asking our fellow Adventurers to fill out a brief survey so that we can get an idea of the average amount of files and subfolders contained in folders that are common to most people.
Here's the survey: https://goo.gl/forms/BEnEumbUvl7I6DOw1 </p>

<p>We will be eternally grateful for your help, and also for all your constant messages of support.
We do personally reply to all of them, all we need is a little patience, but here's a general message: THANK YOU, THANK YOU AND THANK YOU! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!</p>

<p>We love you all,</p>

<p>Evelend Team</p>
