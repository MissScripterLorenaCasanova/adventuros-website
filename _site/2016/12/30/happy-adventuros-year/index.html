    <h2>Happy AdventurOS year!</h2>
    <span class="subt">30 Dec 2016</span>

    <p>Hello Adventurers, we usually don’t detach from reality as a continuum of time, but we cannot help to feel very excited to welcome 2017, the year of AdventurOS, when the first playable version will be available.</p>
<p>It’s been tough and a hell of a learning experience, still with challenges to overcome and a lot of features that we would l love to fit in the first version so we are going to keep working as hard as possible to get them ready.</p>
<p>As it is usual for the development of any game there have been adjustments of features and ideas for a better fit in gameplay and feel of the game, so we will also update you guys on how the game looks and feels like today.</p>
<p>None of the fundamental key points of the game has changed, and the original concept has been kept or even improved.<br />We consider every change implemented as totally worthwhile.</p>

<p>AdventurOS is our shared, nearly accomplished New Year’s resolution, and here’s some more open thoughts on last year and resolutions for the next, with love, by the team members:</p>

<h3>Andre:</h3>
<p>“2016 is over. It happened so fast! With the demands of everyday life plus office work (In Tokyo, this is not to be underestimated) I wasn't able to stay up to my potential.<br />
I would like to focus on making a day for discovery and creativity out of every day, instead of a simple day of obligations and responsibilities, unleashing the creative energy that is boiling inside of me and crying out to get to the outside world.<br />
With my creative self being so hungry, 2017 presents itself as a great opportunity, a delicious feast that is about to be served.<br />
In short, my goal is to close the beginning of this cycle with an explosion of color and sounds. Everything learned will not be in vain. I look forward to starting the year!”</p>

<h3>Lorena:</h3>
<p>“I never believed in calendars but I can’t wait to AdventurOS year!
Besides our upcoming title, I can’t wait to finally going 100% vegan, making it to the Polar Circle and overcoming my horrid, vicious blogging shyness so that I can finally post all the  thoughts and rants that are piling up in the dusty drawer.<br />
I guess I also have a soon-to-be-failed resolution which is rescuing less animals so that maybe I can keep a tiny part of my mental sanity intact (like there’s any left…)<br />
But forget that one cause it’s not gonna happen! The boys know it well.<br />
Seeing the team reunite is another wish for this year, so let's make it happen!<br />
Happy new year everyone!”</p>

<h3>Emilio:</h3>
<p>“It was a long and hard year to overcome but we are finally there. <br />
Since I started working on videogames, my way of thinking about them changed drastically, so my new year's top resolution is to reflect that in the way I continue to develop them, that, and also accepting my path as a computer guy. They say I'm even good at it, so… maybe I can move on and finally drop the rock star career thing! Not the professional path to pursue but I will still have it close to my heart. At least our games' soundtracks will always have a part of me in them. Have a great 2017 guys!”</p>

<p>Thanks for being part of the AdventurOS family and have the greatest start of the year. We love you all!</p>
