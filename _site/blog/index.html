      <span class="subt">30 Dec 2016</span>
      <div>
        <p>Hello Adventurers, we usually don’t detach from reality as a continuum of time, but we cannot help to feel very excited to welcome 2017, the year of AdventurOS, when the first playable version will be available.</p>
<p>It’s been tough and a hell of a learning experience, still with challenges to overcome and a lot of features that we would l love to fit in the first version so we are going to keep working as hard as possible to get them ready.</p>
<p>As it is usual for the development of any game there have been adjustments of features and ideas for a better fit in gameplay and feel of the game, so we will also update you guys on how the game looks and feels like today.</p>
<p>None of the fundamental key points of the game has changed, and the original concept has been kept or even improved.<br />We consider every change implemented as totally worthwhile.</p>

<p>AdventurOS is our shared, nearly accomplished New Year’s resolution, and here’s some more open thoughts on last year and resolutions for the next, with love, by the team members:</p>

<h3>Andre:</h3>
<p>“2016 is over. It happened so fast! With the demands of everyday life plus office work (In Tokyo, this is not to be underestimated) I wasn't able to stay up to my potential.<br />
I would like to focus on making a day for discovery and creativity out of every day, instead of a simple day of obligations and responsibilities, unleashing the creative energy that is boiling inside of me and crying out to get to the outside world.<br />
With my creative self being so hungry, 2017 presents itself as a great opportunity, a delicious feast that is about to be served.<br />
In short, my goal is to close the beginning of this cycle with an explosion of color and sounds. Everything learned will not be in vain. I look forward to starting the year!”</p>

<h3>Lorena:</h3>
<p>“I never believed in calendars but I can’t wait to AdventurOS year!
Besides our upcoming title, I can’t wait to finally going 100% vegan, making it to the Polar Circle and overcoming my horrid, vicious blogging shyness so that I can finally post all the  thoughts and rants that are piling up in the dusty drawer.<br />
I guess I also have a soon-to-be-failed resolution which is rescuing less animals so that maybe I can keep a tiny part of my mental sanity intact (like there’s any left…)<br />
But forget that one cause it’s not gonna happen! The boys know it well.<br />
Seeing the team reunite is another wish for this year, so let's make it happen!<br />
Happy new year everyone!”</p>

<h3>Emilio:</h3>
<p>“It was a long and hard year to overcome but we are finally there. <br />
Since I started working on videogames, my way of thinking about them changed drastically, so my new year's top resolution is to reflect that in the way I continue to develop them, that, and also accepting my path as a computer guy. They say I'm even good at it, so… maybe I can move on and finally drop the rock star career thing! Not the professional path to pursue but I will still have it close to my heart. At least our games' soundtracks will always have a part of me in them. Have a great 2017 guys!”</p>

<p>Thanks for being part of the AdventurOS family and have the greatest start of the year. We love you all!</p>

        <p>When you start the creative process it is all fun and games.
At least until you see how hard to implement those "It'll be cool" ideas are.<br />
In development, things get complicated really fast. We have learned it the hard way. <br />
A good example of this is something that goes unnoticed for most: the “inventory system”.<p>

<p>It is very simple to write "inventory system" on a text note without really understanding how much work it takes to make it materialise, let alone achieving the desired balance.<br />
Once in touch with reality and in order to simplify this process we made a couple of algorithms that help us speed up the process and balance the different sets of items like weapons or potions through automated calculation. This will be re-balanced afterwards with testing. </p>

<p>The drop rate and the price will also be calculated depending on the stats value of the items. This way we can adjust the pros and cons and they will stay balanced in relation to others.</p>

<p>Here you have a screenshot of how this looks in the rough for now:</p>
<img src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1473468213.jpg" />

<p>You can see this properties when you hover the items to see if you are able to use them. <br />
We also added some visual aids under the inventory slots to display the stats affected by the items equipped. <br />
Red means a decrease and green means an upgrade on your current stats.</p>

<p>We've been neglecting updates, but never AdventurOS' development. <br />
Things got boring and most work is repetitive, but this is about to get exciting again.<br />
For anything we have not written about, please feel free to write us on twitter, facebook, steam or the comment section!</p>

<p>We love you all!</p>

<p>Hello dear Adventurers!</p>
<p>Today we come with a special update that covers the development status from all the different fronts of the game, each and every one of them being aspects of it we are very much invested in, and that we wish to be fully satisfied with before presenting it to the world.</p>
<p>We divided it into sections so you get a better picture of how much has been done and what to expect for the first playable version. So, here we go:</p>

<h3>Art</h3>
<p>The items are all ready. Menus? Check! Characters, npcs and mobs are ready to rock. The particles are looking amazing. The music and other assets are also good to go.<br />
We've now finished the bosses and environments for the first release, and they will increase in number in later versions.<br />
Of course we keep future expansions in mind for which we only have drafts but no actual graphics yet, but in general the graphic aspect of the first AdventurOS version is ready to shine bright, with just a few little exceptions here and there.</p>
<p>Some attack and other “in between” animations will be added to the mobs in time.<br />
Some of them already have this, but we will keep making them all look even more alive.</p>

<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>An awesome soundtrack is already rocking our long dev hours, but the last step in development will be implementing sound to the game itself.<br />
Since we are using the terrible, terrible game maker, we decided not to import the audio files until the end to reduce loading time while testing.<br />
We have most of the SFX ready, minus perhaps a few charming sounds to add to our enemies.</p>

<h3>Game Menu</h3>
<p>The menu is finished as stated above, although there is this one section that will not be open to the public until after the release.<br />
We don't consider it to be relevant for now. We want to focus on the main game and add it later as promised to our backers.</p>

<h3>Items</h3>
<p>All the items that are to be included on the first public version of the game are ready.
We have a wide variety of swords, spears, shields and all the other necessary equipment for your player.<br />
The sprites are all ready for action, but we still need to pour a lot of hours into adding and adjusting the different stats of all the items.<br />
Potions also need some extra work. For now every item is being cataloged with a set of general properties shared by all of them.<br />
Our idea is for items to eventually get more interesting and significative effects and uses when equipped or consumed, such as glow, auras and other ideas that sound and will hopefully look great but are still not in development.</p>

<h3>Monsters</h3>
<p>we were initially planning on creating a (perhaps unrealistic) amount of different monster behaviors. This is an area that we are actively developing right now. Unfortunately, the boss fights will have to be delayed and be added in an update after the initial beta release.</p>

<h3>NPCS</h3>
<p>We have implemented 8 types of reasonably functional NPCS.<br />
We still need to generate the NPCS that will give you quests. A lot more work needs to be invested in this area, it goes hand in hand with the monsters since both are based off your files and the development process is similar.</p>

<h3>Quests</h3>
<p>The basic functionality of quests is working. You can take, locate, and complete quests.<br />
We also have a long list of different kinds of missions to add but we still need to merge both worlds. After this and the usual testing, there will be a lot of things to do while you are fighting enemies and discovering the secret life of your files.</p>

<h3>Character skills and abilities</h3>
<p>The skills and abilities of the main character are half way done. We have some of the abilities that facilitate movement on the map, and some magic skills. The last ones on the progression tree have to be developed as well as the overall testing and balancing of the damage/mana cost, all of them also tested within the gameflow. </p>

<h3>Other areas</h3>
<p>There are a lot of areas that are not that easy to catalog or are too big to explain.<br />
We wanted to make this article to let you know how the game is evolving and of course we can answer any further questions in the comment section.</p>

<p>We understand that it has been a long time since we started this adventure together. We apologize for the delay and we promise it will all be worth it.</p>
