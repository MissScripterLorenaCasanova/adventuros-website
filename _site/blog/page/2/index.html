<p>Hello there dear Adventurers!<br />
Special kudos to our newsletter&rsquo;s subscribers! You will definitely be the first ones to read the blog entry, so welcome! If you wish to subscribe but haven&rsquo;t yet, just <a href="http://eepurl.com/b3dF7b">CLICK HERE</a>.<br />
<br />
Today we bring you a very interesting topic: The enemies.<br />
<br />
The monsters are crucial for AdventurOS to be the fun game it is.<br />
Getting your own files to chase you around is really cool! However, adjustments have had to be made along the development process.<br />
When we started coding the artificial intelligence of the enemies, we made them pretty good at killing you. They could see where you were and where you were running to, plus they dodged your attacks.<br />
After play testing a little bit we realised they were out of proportion. If you analyze the monsters in similar titles, you will notice that those monsters follow patterns.<br />
You hardly ever come across a game where enemies show diverse ways to approach you. Instead, they repeat patterns and therefore become predictable. Why? Because, when well calibrated, getting to know how to defeat predictable enemies is very entertaining.<br />
And that is how we noticed AdventurOS needed to undergo such calibration too.<br />
You need gracefully choreographed actions to defeat your enemies, so knowing how they will behave is the most important skill to master if you wish to succeed.<br />
Too effective monsters can be very frustrating, so in order to make the game fairer to the player, we basically started from scratch and redesigned the different patterns.<br />
<br />
There are two main kinds of enemies in AdventurOS, the ones who can fly and the ones who can&#39;t.<br />
Flying monsters can be tricky to implement sometimes. They are pretty simple to code but at the same time it is not easy to find ways in which flying monsters can make navigating harder, which is the usual goal of flying enemies in levels.<br />
On the other hand, we have the walking monsters which are there to challenge your skills and test your abilities. They are harder to defeat and always ready to surprise you. But in AdventurOS you can bend the rules and use the elements in your favor to turn those hard fights into an easier task. After all, you can easily extinguish a fire with water, can&rsquo;t you?<br />

Thanks for all the positive feedback we keep receiving. Please feel free to send those aspects of the game you are curious about, and we will do our best to give you a closer look into it through the gates of the amazing AdventurOS castle.<br />
<br />
We love you all!</p>

      <span class="subt">09 May 2016</span>
      <div>
        <p>Hello there!<br />
We know it has been a long time, and we thank you all for your kind messages of support!<br />
We would like to encourage all of you guys to send us your inquiries because we think you deserve our feedback and we really want to be there for you.<br />
<br />
Today we want to tell you a little bit more about what&#39;s behind the design process of AdventurOS. The game.<br />
When we started flirting with the idea of creating a world out of each computer&#39;s files and folders, we encountered a lot of problems and exciting riddles to solve (to say the least!)</p>

<p><img alt="" style="margin-right: 20px; max-width: 200px; display:inline-block; float:left;" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1462843259.jpg" />A classic one is the zip files being interpreted as chests. When you have a game in mind that enables the player to create the rooms, you have to make sure the design includes measures to avoid cheating.</p>

<p>In order to fix the problem of the player having the chance of creating unlimited chests, what we did was simple: We added a key for each chest you want to open.</p>

<p>This makes getting keys necessary before being able to open chests. And, how do you get those keys?</p>

<p>The keys are only earned by killing files, so if you want to open all the chests in that chamber that you just smartly created, you have a long way ahead of you!</p>

<p>Another issue has to do with the room generation process.</p>

<p>It is very hard to create a procedural world that is connected so that the player progresses, while you must also add obstacles to block access to certain rooms so that the game still makes sense. If that makes sense.</p>

<p>As you already know, metroidvania games give you abilities that invite you to re-explore areas that you have already visited in order to unlock extra content.</p>

<p>In AdventurOS you will need to get this special abilities by earning Adventure Points.</p>

<p>There are several ways of bypassing the special barriers created for you to overcome, and by exploring you will acquire the skills needed for that purpose.</p>

<p>You can get Adventure Points by visiting new areas or cleaning rooms in the castle or by finishing quests given to you by friendly NPCs. Long story short, the more adventurous you are, the more Adventure Points you can earn!</p>

<p>This has improved the pacing of the game. You will keep discovering when you are able to face each new challenge ahead.</p>

<p>A lot of ideas that we thought were amazing turned out to be &quot;not so good&quot; once the prototype began to be playable, but the iteration process is making them all fit in place to ensure that the game will turn out to be fun and enjoyable.</p>

<p><img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1462843170.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is a long and painful process that taught us many things, what not to do among them, but soon enough we will enter the &ldquo;Now we are talking&rdquo; era for our dear baby game AdventurOS, and we will be very excited to welcome you all to enjoy it with us.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and we&#39;ll keep you posted, promise!</p>

<p>We love you all!</p>

        <p>Dear Adventurers,</p>

<p>Ninety nine point nine percent of your messages are of pure support and full of words of encouragement. There are, however, a few exceptions that show understandable signs of impatience about our release.</p>

<p>Let us give you some perspective on this: <br />
As AdventurOS parents, we decided to do this, and we decided to do this well.
The game has never been cancelled, and it will never be. That is out of the question, so everybody relax.<br />
This is a ship that's being tricky to drive but that is far from sinking.  </p>

<p>We work on it daily since day one and we keep working very hard.
AdventurOS is a game that we stupid newbies thought would be a piece of cake but turned out to be a titanic project.
We are just a crew of three and our funding was encouraging but merely anecdotic, so we must keep a regular job each to stay alive. So that we can develop AdventurOS.</p>

<p>For our baby game we have all turned our backs to many other life opportunities so that we can keep working on this and finally make it happen.
You have all probably read about all the bureaucratic issues we also had and still have, which just adds up to the pile of shit independent developers must go through.
But for every challenge that's put in our way we just say BRING IT ON! even louder than before and get immediately back to work.</p>

<p>We just want to go through it as gracefully as possible, without stepping on any of our principles (after all, that's what having no boss should mean) and it turns out that, in the meantime, many ideas were implemented in the now enormous AdventurOS snowball, so the tiny indie game we advertised is going to come up as an out of proportion piece of gaming awesomeness. This means that we must apologize for our unrealistic deadline and consequent delay, but that after all you guys will eventually get a game that is worth much more than what you initially paid for it.</p>

<p>We have discussed this before with our main backers and countless regular backers, and we all agree on a "product over deadline" approach.
By the way, thank you guys for walking this path alongside us!
We thank you for your patience and understanding of the full picture, and AdventurOS is going to be everyone's reward.</p>

<p>Big hugs, we love you all.</p>

<p>AdventurOS Team.</p>
