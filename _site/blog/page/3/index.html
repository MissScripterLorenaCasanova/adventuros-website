      <span class="subt">01 Jan 2016</span>
      <div>
        <p>Hello everyone! Our months working together in Tokyo were wonderful development-wise, but now it's time to part and be back to remote collaboration.</p>

<p>We will miss each other very much.</p>

<p>Should our passport country (Spain) be in a different phase, I think we'd all give settling here a shot. However, this country is far from being a self-employed or freelance-friendly one, and it is especially unadvised if you work in the software industry.</p>

<p>There is a chance that the strongest emergent party could change that in the long run, but it does not seem to be going to happen in the near future. Now Spain doesn't even have a government to begin with!</p>

<p>Whatever happens, and wherever each of us chooses to spend 2016, we have just charged batteries together and are determined to take AdventurOS very far. We apologize again for the unrealistc deadline we once set, but it will all be worth it, for us and also for you guys.</p>

<p>We have so far walked a path of exploration and discovery of our own profession, of the industry and all other (rather stupid) rules that may (and will!) apply. </p>

<p>Thanks for walking along with us!</p>

<p>Now, if you are curious about what's lately on our desks, we can start by telling you how pleased we are to have replaced the Python indexer side with golang.</p>

<p>Also, the Story Mode took shape and we are loving it!</p>

<p>Development processes are usually surrounded by much secrecy, but this time we have cool footage to show you guys, and you can choose what to see next by leaving your suggestions in the comments below.</p>

<p>We love you all!</p>

<p>Good morning, afternoon and evening, fellow Adventurers!</p>

<p>We Evelend team are fully focused on work here in Tokyo. We are now reunited and able to share the same “office” and to finally work side by side after so much remote collaboration.</p>
<p>We are a having a very productive time here, but we have a limited number of months to spend together, so the goals are making the best out of it and pave the way for a smooth transition back to remote work when it’s time to part again. Sigh...</p>

<p>Most of our latest work has been focused on the replacement of all the code in Python by code in Go (golang), because of Python’s limitations when it comes to distributing executables.</p>
<p>This is especially an issue for Windows users, given that OSX and Linux have it pre-installed.</p>
<p>These Windudes messing with us again… but hey! a deal is a deal and this game is going to be available to all!</p>

<p>Those kind Indiegogo contributors who chose the highest perks should have received an email from us about displaying their info in AdventurOS credits, so if you are one of those contributors but you have not received the email, please get in touch with us!</p>

<p>And now a thank you note to all our supporters.Big and small. Pioneer and late additions. Thank you so much. This is all possible thanks to you.</p>

<p>We wish you a wonderful gaming time, see you soon for more updates about AdventurOS game! </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Love you all!</p>

<p>Hello dear friends,<br />
This letter will disappoint many, but not those you are thinking. This update of ours will disappoint the ones systematically mentioning, almost seeming to wish, our development interruption. To all those, we are sorry. Brace yourselves. AdventurOS is coming.</p>

<p>This is, however, not the announcement of its release, but it is getting closer.</p>

<p>For those who don&#39;t know, AdventurOS team went to hell and back to make this possible.</p>

<p>We had all sorts of administrative problems and we could not fix them all yet. Not even by moving to other countries and continents with the sole purpose of paperwork for release.<br />
Since ours was already a team of globetrotters, we just tried to go through it all as gracefully as possible, and even though we needed other jobs to keep us going, AdventurOS development has, not a single day, become the one on the side.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This world is definitely not made for independent authors, but we know exactly in which way we want this handled, we know we have the right to it and the ability to do it without intermediaries, and we will not rest until we get there.</p>

<p>AdventurOS will be out before we reach our actual goal (the Steam release) because our bureaucratic delay forced us to make Steam also wait.<br />
We then pushed &quot;hype and exposition theories&quot; away and decided to launch AdventurOS independently on our site as soon as we are happy with it, and save our spot on Steam for later.<br />
This way we will give you access as soon as possible, regardless of when we get the chance to peak in our sales through bigger platforms. If that is ever happening.<br />
Revenue has become secondary in our struggle to stay independent and do things our way, paving the way to others who might want to do the same.</p>

<p>Once we figure this out ourselves, we will undoubtedly put all the info out there for those considering joining the industry, but first we need to learn. We hope all our war scars are of service to others some time in the near future.</p>

<p>Having to postpone our initial, naive deadline, and getting such avalanche of words and gestures of support from the community definitely helped us staying strong, and believe us, we are soon paying you guys back by modestly launching on our site, with you in mind instead of our own sales strategy.</p>

<p>Quick note to our kind contributors with highest donations, please remember your version of AdventurOS will always keep updating on Dropbox. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or technical issues, and enjoy!</p>

<p>AdventurOS development will most probably speed up from today.<br />
We all finally made it to Tokyo, and we have not met yet, but we will very soon reunite and we&#39;ll finally work in the same room again. We can&#39;t wait!</p>

<p>For any of you currently staying in Tokyo, we will be happy to meet up, preferably off the beaten track.</p>

<p>Lots of dev love from Japan,</p>

<p>Evelend Team.</p>
