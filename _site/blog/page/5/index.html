        <p>Greetings Adventurers!<br />
<br />
First of all, thank you ever so much for your words and gestures of support.<br />
You will very soon be playing the super awesome AdventurOS.<br />
<br />
Today we are letting you look through a crack of our castle&#39;s wall.<br />
Here you have several gameplay gifs.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/cY4wrFC.gif" /><br />
<br />
Among other elements, we are working on the environment, the power-ups and the monsters, and the result is a much better flow when it comes to gameplay.<br />
Also, many spells have already been implemented, and they look and feel great!<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kTKyZCu.gif" /><br />
<br />
There will be 7 different kinds of spells and 6 elements. These combined make a total of 42 spells to discover and master!<br />
<br />

<br />
We are also proud to announce that once the game is out for sale, we will accept bitcoins, as so many of you wished and kindly requested.<br />
It will be available as an alternative to the conventional currencies or services.<br />
<br />
Thank you so very much for your patience. We promise it will all be worth it!<br />
<br />
We love you all!</p>

        <p>Happy new year,&nbsp;dear&nbsp;Adventurers!<br />
Last year was&nbsp;full of adventures of all kinds for Evelend&nbsp;team, and this one will be full of adventures for you!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We are very&nbsp;excited to see what lies&nbsp;ahead for all of us immediately after&nbsp;the last steps of our&nbsp;bureaucratic&nbsp;odyssey.<br />
We wish we could have given&nbsp;an earlier release, but the bright side is that AdventurOS becomes more and more&nbsp;awesome every day in the meantime.<br />
We want to&nbsp;thank you all for&nbsp;your messages and gestures of support and we are sure this will be worth all the efforts we put into it.<br />
<br />
Today we are unfolding&nbsp;AdventurOS development a&nbsp;bit more for you.<br />
<br />
Firstly, a&nbsp;big improvement is taking place right now.<br />
A second engine that will make mobs way more&nbsp;dynamic and fun to play is being&nbsp;implemented&nbsp;and will be merged with the current one.&nbsp;<br />
We are focused&nbsp;on providing&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;fights, a broader spectrum of&nbsp;skills&nbsp;and overall better&nbsp;flow at our castle&#39;s platforms,&nbsp;making the experience&nbsp;more&nbsp;interesting and enjoyable.</p>

<p><a href="http://images.evelend.com/images/1421294246.png"><img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1421294246.png" /></a></p>

<p>Secondly, we have also improved a few other things, getting as a result:<br />
<br />
- A higher number of ways to personalize your monsters through&nbsp;the&nbsp;mob customization system.<br />
- A more efficient&nbsp;light engine that allows a better performance<br />
- A&nbsp;room interpreter that will make our castle&nbsp;resemble our computer&#39;s&nbsp;visible folders and files&nbsp;even better.</p>

<p>Some&nbsp;upgrades wished by the team for&nbsp;AdventurOS&#39;&nbsp;first release&nbsp;are&nbsp;yet to be crafted, but we are positive&nbsp;the upcoming release will contain them all.<br />
<br />
All features in general&nbsp;continue&nbsp;according to plan&nbsp;and we have an early version of the game running for the&nbsp;contributors to our Indiegogo campaign with the highest perks.</p>

<p>Besides the administrative struggle for the sake of independence, we have also encountered a lot of technical challenges in the process of development,&nbsp;but we guess that is something to expect when you work&nbsp;on a product that is just unique.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We can&#39;t wait to put it out there!</p>

<p>We would like&nbsp;to remind&nbsp;everyone who has contributed to the Indiegogo campaign with the &ldquo;CD&rdquo; perk (and higher)&nbsp;that you should have received a link to the OST via&nbsp;e-mail.<br />
In case&nbsp;you did not receive&nbsp;the e-mail, please feel free to get in touch!<br />
Remember you can write to&nbsp;info@evelend.com or <a href="mailto:evelend.info@gmail.com">evelend.info@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;and we will&nbsp;deliver your perk right away.</p>

<p>AdventurOS is coming soon, our dear Adventurers! In the meantime,&nbsp;here are some&nbsp;recent screenshots you can check out.</p>

        <p>Hello again, our dear Adventurers!<br />
<br />
Regardless of the bitter side of being indies and on our own, we are enjoying every second of development of the game, and you will very soon be playing it your way, at your very own realm.<br />
We are a team of three grinches, all equally overwhelmed and confused by Christmas time. However, we know for many it does bring reunions and well deserved free time. Maybe you are up to some AdventurOS music?<br />
<br />
It is just about time for contributors with Floppy-disc perk or higher to enjoy the volume I of the amazing AdventurOS OST.<br />
<p>

You will receive an email with the download link. It contains nineteen beautifully composed songs by our inimitable artist Mr. Andr&eacute; Mar&iacute; Coppola. Check it out and&hellip;<br />
<br />
ENJOY!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support! We love you all!</p>
