        <p>Hello dear Adventurers,<br />
<br />
You might be aware of the latest news regarding our bureaucratic struggle. In case you are not, you might be interested in checking out <a href="http://lorena.evelend.com/bureaucrazy/">Lorena&rsquo;s article</a> on the subject.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, development keeps moving forward. And we can&rsquo;t wait to the Early Access release!<br />
<br />
Today we will give you a glimpse of another small piece of AdventurOS: Lately we have focused on improving the skill menu, so here&rsquo;s a teaser:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1412291168.jpg" /></p>

<p>Every time you perform an adventure related action (Entering unopened rooms, completing a quest, defeating a boss) you will earn Adventure Points. With this special points you will be able to build your character skills the way you want them by selecting your chosen formula between magic upgrades, weapon skills or abilities.</p>

<p>When creating your character a few basic skills will be already active so you can start with a preset.</p>

<p>You can follow this process and more through our site. You can stay updated by the team on <a href="https://twitter.com/AdventurOSgame">Twitter </a>too.<br />
We also had the nice surprise of finding out a kind active member of Reddit had long ago created a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/adventuros/">subreddit about AdventurOS</a>, and he has gifted us the chance to participate and keep it up to date too. Check it out!<br />
<br />
We would like to thank you once more for your support. We are flooded with kind words and warm wishes and we are doing our best to reach everyone back as soon as possible. Once again, thank you so much. We love you all!</p>

        <p>Greetings, dear AdventurOS family!<br />
<img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1409778487.png" /><br />
We remain in that point where the job is done but the bureaucracy to release it is not yet sorted out.<br />
The struggle is so big right now that all of us three have even moved in order to survive this delay.<br />
<br />
However, not everything is a struggle. AdventurOS still has most part of our energy and attention. This is good for us, as this is an awesome process that we are proud to be part of, and it is also good for you, because the first releasable version keeps getting better and better, so once it is out, it will be a much better product than we thought it would be at its Early Access stage.<br />
The least we can do to make up for the delay is keeping up the constantly increasing game awesomeness.<br />
<br />
Today we will tease you a little bit more by introducing you to your main character and its possibilities.</p>

<p>The adventure will happen on your computer, but who is our protagonist?</p>

<p>The gameplay will follow the adventures of a simple file you will create.<br />
You will be able to customize that file in many ways.<br />
Gender, name, and hairstyle are attributes that other games already let you personalize when it comes to character customization, but what&#39;s unique about AdventurOS is that since our hero is a file, you get to choose its extension.<br />
What will that mean for your hero?<br />
Each extension will have different attributes, skills and items to begin with, and the player will adopt the color of that extension&rsquo;s family, having the other files with the same extension as allies.<br />
<img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1409778030.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;
<p>The high perk contributors to our Indiegogo campaign should expect an upgrade and more news very soon.<br />
If you did not make it to the campaign but want to support AdventurOS development, you can pre-purchase <a href="http://adventuros.evelend.com/store">here</a>.<br />
<br />
We would also like to thank you all for your support messages. We like to personally write back to everyone and we do our best to not to delay much in our replies.<br />
<br />
So, as always, thank you all so much! We love you!</p>

      <span class="subt">06 Aug 2014</span>
      <div>
        <p>Lately we introduced you to our <a href="http://adventuros.evelend.com/blog/11">monster creator</a> and today we proudly present our latest addition to the AdventurOS toolset:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1407375397.png" /></p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1407375731.png" /></p>

<p>With the item creator, you can create (no shit Sherlock) any item for the game and share it with your friends as well.<br />
The price and drop rate of your item will be automatically generated based on its stats. By doing this we avoid disproportionate items on the game, so whatever you create will stay balanced with the rest.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1407375417.png" /></p>

<p>Thank you very much for all the <a href="http://adventuros.evelend.com/store/">pre-purchases</a>!<br />
Oh! And&hellip; on that note&hellip; we have another surprise for you!<br />
If you are one of the pre-purchasers, you have automatically entered a raffle.<br />
The winner will be able to take part of the alpha testing too!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>

<p>Hugs from the AdventurOS team!<br />
- Andr&eacute;, Emilio and Lorena &hearts;</p>
