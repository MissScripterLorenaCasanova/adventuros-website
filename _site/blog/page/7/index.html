      <span class="subt">24 Jul 2014</span>
      <div>
        <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>We have so far talked about NPCs and monsters. Today we will focus on the sceneries where all the fun will take place!</p>
<p><img src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1406194474.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Environments will be created according to the type of file that is the most abundant within each folder.</p>

<p>Today we introduce you some of the environments you will find while exploring your computer.</p>

<h3>The Library.</h3>

<p><img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1406130635.png" style="float:right;padding-left:10px" /></p>

<p>The library is the centre where the scribes belong. It is where all information of the realm is gathered and kept for further study that will help you Adventurers in your quest.
Libraries will be generated in the folders containing a majority of text files and the like. They can be of varying sizes and number of floors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Help the scribes broadening their knowledge by sharing your discoveries!</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>The Temple.</h3>

<p><img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1406130673.png" style="float:left;padding-right:10px" /></p>
<p>The temples are a space for connection with the Great Architect. They will be generated out of folders containing a majority of audio files.
<br /><br />
Music is considered the best way of spiritual expression in this realm.<br />
The monks count on great power and influence, so having them as allies will certainly help you in you adventure.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>The Village</h3>

<p><img alt="" src="http://images.evelend.com/images/1406130661.png" style="float:right;padding-left:10px" /></p>

<p>In the villages is where you will find the highest density of population. Both the villages and the forests are generated out of the folders in which images are predominant.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Earn their support and make your own prestige increase by helping them!</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>These are only three examples among many other environments you will be able to explore.<br />
Stay tuned for more teasers!</p>

<p>Love you all,<br />
The team.</p>

<p>Hello our dear Adventurers! We have a very good surprise for you!</p>

<p>We have worked a lot to get where AdventurOS is today, and by now you already know how much we are struggling to finally put the result out there. For those who need to refresh it here is Lorena&#39;s <a href="http://lorena.evelend.com/indie-heaven-and-hell/">illustrative article.</a></p>

<p>We have contacted each and every one of you privately, but we would also like to publicly thank you for all the great feedback we got after sharing our experience, for the support letters and messages, for your tweets and retweets, for spreading the AdventurOS word and for all the different ways in which you have showed us your love. You are an amazing source of indie gaming awesomeness. Really.</p>

<p>Among all messages and within the whole development period we have got flooded with requests for us to accept donations and pre-purchases.</p>

<p>Besides the<a href="https://sellfy.com/p/vL28/"> wallpapers pack</a>, there has been no chance to purchase anything after AdventurOS Indiegogo campaign finished.</p>

<p>UNTIL NOW!</p>

<p>If you are reading this, then the AdventurOS <a href="http://adventuros.evelend.com/store/">pre-purchase option</a> is already up and running.</p>

<p>Our delay, forced by our unexpected bureaucratic problems, motivated us to keep improving what was supposed to be the first Beta version, by adding more content. And more. And more! We are also polishing the existing features. And polishing... and polishing.</p>

<p>This train moves forward at full speed and the whole thing looks damn good!</p>

<p>Once the first Early Access version is out, you will receive that one plus all further builds.</p>

<p>Only the few brave people who trusted us with contributions for the right perks on Indiegogo from the very beginning can enjoy the privilege of playing the latest alpha builds of the game before the early-access release.</p>

<p>But it won&#39;t be long before all of you get the great looking AdventurOS Early Access that will soon see the light on Steam!</p>

<p>We hope we are properly reaching everyone and listening to all requests.</p>

<p>Besides everything explained above, and after many messages requesting the same, we have finally created a <a href="http://adventuros.evelend.com/blog/feed/">RSS feed</a> for everyone to stay updated from now on through any chosen reader.</p>

<p>We feel utterly happy to see how AdventurOS concept, which we once wanted to bring to life out of pure creativity and passion, quickly becomes contagiously wished and supported by so many people.</p>

<p>And we are making it happen!</p>

<p>Thanks again for everything and let there be games!</p>

<p>Love,<br />
Evelend Team</p>

      <a href="/2014/06/27/development-update-9/"><h2>Development Update #9</h2></a>
      <span class="subt">27 Jun 2014</span>
      <div>
        <p>Hello once again for some refreshing news on AdventurOS development.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1gaYxXw.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Many people have asked us about the file extensions that might not be recognized by default in AdventurOS. </p>
<p>If the game encounters an extension that was not contemplated on our design, a random monster will spawn taking that extension's role.</p>
<p>BUT, what if we do not want a random monster in one of our custom extensions? We have a way cooler option for you guys!</p>
<p>Allow us to introduce you to the Monster Creator!</p>
<p><img src="/images/preview/monstereditor.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With this simple program you will be able to create and edit monsters so they can be bound with any file extension you want.</p>
<p>For instance, letâ€™s say we have a saved file called "my_game.sav" and we want AdventurOS to generate a fire monkey whenever we find any .sav file.</p>
<p><img src="/images/preview/firemonkey.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After creating this monster you will find it in game whenever you come across files with your chosen extension for that monster to appear.</p>
<p><img src="/images/preview/ingame.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>An awesome feature of the Monster Creator is the possibility to share your monsters with other Adventurers if you wish to.</p>
<p>You will also be able to download and use other people's creations with a simple url pasting.</p>
<p><img src="/images/preview/import.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We have some other teasers to give you today:</p>

<h3>Meet the Mechanic</h3>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/93zGYuy.png" alt="" />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/oUSmQOH.gif" alt="" />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kCj01ko.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><b>Mechanics</b> (Created from shortcuts) Their mission will be protecting the links between rooms and managing all the portal system of the castle.<br />
They will be the ones with tools such as locked doors or hyperlinks. </p>

<h3>Meet the Monk</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JDQP6gp.png" alt="" />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jVeekmB.gif" alt="" />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Lhv9znO.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><b>Monks</b> (Created out of all kinds of audio files) Each audio file generates a monk plus a CD item.<br />
When the item is given to a monk, it stays attached to the monk as the piece they will later interpret by turns, because, you know, that will be their thing.<br />
We expect the monks to reproduce your audio files, but we cannot promise the will not include funny distortions too!<br />
While the monks sing, you can receive useful temporary buffs such as increased experience.</p>

<p>We will hopefully be sharing AdventurOS fun very soon. Meantime, we want to thank you all for all the great support we are receiving!<br /><br />

Cheers!<br />
The team.</p>
